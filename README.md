# Online Bioengineering Quiz Generator

## Overview of the Project

This project is an **Online Quiz/Test Generator** specifically designed for bioengineering students. It provides user login/registration and allows students to take quizzes related to bioengineering topics directly from a Google Colab notebook. The application uses Python and `ipywidgets` for interactive UI. Immediate feedback and scoring make it a useful tool for learning and self-assessment.

## Features

- User Registration and Login (username-based)
- Interactive quiz interface
- Three bioengineering-related questions (modifiable)
- Instant scoring and correct-answer feedback
- All operations run in-memory (no database setup required)
- Runs seamlessly in Google Colab

## Technologies/Tools Used

- Python 3 (Google Colab runtime)
- ipywidgets (for UI/interaction)
- IPython.display (for output management)

## Steps to Install & Run the Project

1. **Open a new notebook in Google Colab.**
2. **Copy the provided code for the quiz generator into a code cell.**
3. **Run the cell.**
   - No package installation needed (ipywidgets is pre-installed in Colab).
4. **Follow on-screen prompts to register or log in, and take the quiz.**

## Instructions for Testing

- Enter a username and register if new, or log in if already registered.
- After login, the quiz with three bioengineering questions will appear.
- Select your answer for each question.
- Click **Submit Quiz** to see your score and feedback.
- To test multiple users, rerun the cell and use different usernames.
